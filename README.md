# **NLP Task**

This project involves solving two NLP tasks: calculating **word similarity** and **sentence similarity**. The tasks are implemented using custom approaches and pretrained models, and the details are as follows:

---

## **Task 1: Word Similarity**

### **File**: `cbow.ipynb`
This file contains the code for the constrained model.
### **File**: `word2vec.ipynb`
This file contains the code for unconstrained model

## **Task 2: Phrase and Sentence Similarity**

### **File**: `sentence_similarity.ipynb`,`sentence_similarity_2.ipynb`,`sentence_similarity_3.ipynb`
These files contain the codes for the various approaches which I have used for predicting sentence similarities mentioned in the report.

## **Task 3: Bonus Task**

### **File**: `zero-shot.ipynb`,`bonus_2.ipynb`,`sentence_transformer.ipynb`
These files contain the codes for the sub-parts of the bonus tasks.

## **Final Analysis**

### **File**: `analysis.ipynb`
This file contains the final analysis.
